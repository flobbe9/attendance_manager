# Deploy
## ios credentials
The `eas build` command expects some credentials to be uploaded in eas cloud. This needs to be done once locally and does not happen in the pipeline. See docs below.

# Debugging
## `drizzle-kit generate` failing
- Could be because of "expo-constants" module. Don't know why but commenting it out in constants.ts can solve the issue.

## .env
The `eas build` command does not seem to use the .env variables (according to this post that is: https://www.reddit.com/r/expo/comments/1feh09e/solution_for_using_environment_variables_in_expo/).
